# Blocky
A java-based Blocky game

Use TestGame.java to start the game

The goal of the game is to put the most possible units of a given color c on the outer perimeter of the board. The playerâ€™s score is the total number of unit cells of color c that are on the perimeter. There is a premium on corner cells: they count twice towards the score. After each move, the player sees their score, determined by how well they have achieved their goal. The game continues for a certain number of turns or until the user runs out of moves (in this assignment, we will allow an unlimited number of moves).
